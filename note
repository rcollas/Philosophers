usleep suspends thread execution for usec microseconds
when a philosophers is eating, all others threads aka philo should be suspend using usleep
if the value of usleep is greater than 'time_to_die', the philo dies and prgm exit
there's a fork between each philo
if a philo takes a fork, the fork should be protected with a mutex, making it unavailable
for the others philo
